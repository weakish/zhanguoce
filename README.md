Chinese ancient book 戰國策 in markdown format.

You can:

- read it online
- fork this repo
- convert it to other format

as you like.

The text is in public domain.

I put the original html files in the wikisource directory.
You can also find the scripts I wrote to download and convert them in that directory.
I think they may be useful for processing other text from wikisource.
